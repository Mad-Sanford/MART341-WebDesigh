What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack?
Sometimes, fonts don't always work out, and you need ones you can fall back on.
What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font?
Web fonts are not installed on every operating system and device, and web-safe fonts are pre-installed on most computers.

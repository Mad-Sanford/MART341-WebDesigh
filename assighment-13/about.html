<p>
  Growing up in Montana, I’ve been around art for as long as I can remember. My father is a graphic designer, and my grandmother is an artist. Some of my first memories involve going to her art shows and spending time in her home filled with things she’d created. I have always treasured producing, observing, and educating. I started teaching skiing at fourteen years old and with my expansive volunteering with Special Olympics, I thought the most practical route would be to become a teacher. When I began my secondary education at the University of Montana Western in the art educator program, I found myself more interested in my art classes than my teaching ones. I excelled in the local art community and got my first commission through the Paris Gibson Square Museum of Arts. I felt burnout from my already ample teaching background. So I altered my course, decided I wanted to focus on my art and didn’t want to teach right after college. I felt inexperienced as an artist and desired to explore it more fully. When covid hit, there was uncertainty that UM Western would still have a ceramic program, so I transferred to the University of Montana in Missoula, where I currently work at the Zootown Arts Community Center as I finish up my Bachelors of Fine Arts. I fell for ceramics and sculpture. The material processes are the most intriguing for me and the uncertainty. In each clay stage, there is a chance that it won't turn out the way you expect. I find the material relatable in that way. As I grow, my current style is pushing the physical limits of the material to create and explore the natural texture of clay.

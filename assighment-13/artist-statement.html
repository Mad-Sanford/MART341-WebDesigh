  This body of work is about the process of breaking and rebuilding. It shows the scars that are left after the act. I pushed the material to its limits during construction to create faults within the clay. Then mend it back together internally, so they stand upright while still retaining their faults. As I was building, I had an internal dialog of self-value. I doubted myself through this entire process. I was skeptical about what would become of my mounds of clay. Regardless, I kept working on them, preparing a glaze palette that would soften the faults and emphasize the crevices. Repairing from the inside makes the pieces stronger while still exposing the fractures that occurred during the corse.

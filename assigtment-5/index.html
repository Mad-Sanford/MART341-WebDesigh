      Background
  </h3>
  <p>
    Born in Montana, surrounded by artists, I have always been in a sea of creative energy that has supported my love for production. As a person with dyslexia, I picture things metaphorically and symbolically, giving me a unique perspective on our reality.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Medium
  </h3>
  <p>
    I use many different mediums, such as clay, acrylics, and charcoal. I believe that working in a single medium is restrictive to my artistic process. Each idea manifests in its own individual style.
  </p>

  <h3>
    Inspiration
  </h3>
  <p>
    I pull inspiration out of all moments, from what I experience with anything and everything outside of myself all the way to the blissful and despairing moments alone in my mind.
